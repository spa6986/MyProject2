<h1> Weirdest pets possible</h1>
<div>
<h3> The scorpion!</h3>
<p> While being slightly terrifying- Okay, incredibly- some people would say scorpions make good pets! They dont require much tending
too. You don't really need to feed them, they can do that themselves. There is literally no shedding! Most of the time they don't get in
your way, either. So if you enjoy having a freaky insect roaming your house and scaring your guests, maybe you should get one! But
never invite me over, thanks. </p>

<h3> The sugar glider </h3>
<div>
<p>This adorable little animal is tiny, has huge eyes, and looks great on the mantle. It only has one, small problem. It has four different
scents to mark it's territory. Four! Also it poops a lot, and can fly. You might want to get plastic curtains </p>
<div>
<div>
<h3> The hissing cockroach </h3>
<div>
<p> The hissing cockroach is a very, very, very, um.... Popular? Pet? Maybe? Why would someone want to get a hissing cockroach?!?! Those
things are freaky! I don't understand. Why would someone want a gross, little... abomination like that as a pet? But, you know, you
do you, I guess. Just do you away from me. </p>

<h3> The fennec fox </h3>
<div>
<p>The fennec fox is a little tan creature, that is quite possibly the most adorable thing you've seen since Pikachu. It's got these huge, 
elf-like ears, and has tiny eyes that seem to be perpetually squinting. You should get one. Then invite me over. I WANT TO PET IT. </p>
<div>
<div>
<h3> The squirrel monkey </h3>
<div>
<p> The squirrel monkey looks like a monkey, is tiny like a squirrel, and acts like a mixture of both. It's angry and eats everything, 
and inside it's cute little face probably wants to first explode the world, then set fire to the sun. Somehow. I'm not sure how it 
would do that, but squirrel monkeys aren't known for their smarts.
